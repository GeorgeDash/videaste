With my latest and hardest yet project, I put myself up to a challenge - to recreate a website, based on a concept, from *scratch*. That's why I'm very proud with it - because not only was I able to make the website functional, but also make a **responsive** version (yeah, the concept was only for desktop)! Also, here I finally showed my real porgramming skills and that everything is possible **only** when you're confident in yourself!

I want to give a *huge* shoutout to [Adhiari Subekti](https://biolinky.co/designdhiari) - part of the [One Week Wonders](https://www.oneweekwonders.com/) team - for the inspiration and the **awesome** [design concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/23090247-Videaste-Personal-Videographer-Portfolio-Landing-Page-Website)! ðŸ’–

ANOTHER RECREATION!?
===

Yep, that's right! I may or may not have decided that I'm going to make another recreation of one of Adhiari's concepts (I even chose it already). However, keep in mind that I'm still a student (in 9th grade, to be exact) and the and I can start at **the earliest** during fall break, which here starts on *October 30th*.

Final words
====
So, with all that said, I hope you like my âœ¨*very cutesy, very demure, very mindful*âœ¨ project, and I'll see you in the next one! ðŸ˜‰
